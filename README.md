# Application-Project
First Commitment

Hello welcome to my aplication project, this program is intended to be used to access information
and add information to a database for products for your company.<br/>
On the first tab we have the 'Production Line' where you can add **product names** their **manufacturer** and **item type**.
Also in this tab we have a 'Existing Products' box giving you information on products already stored in the system.<br/>
On the second tab, the 'Produce' tab, we have a 'Chose Product' box for you to select what product you want to record production of
and a 'Choose Quantity' box to allow you to choose the amount you've produced. When the correct product is selected and the correct quantity
there is a **Record Production** button conveniently placed to record your information.<br/>
